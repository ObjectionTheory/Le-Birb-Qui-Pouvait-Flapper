          <h3>Unnecessary Backstory</h3>
          <div>
            <p style="font-size: 10px">
              Since he was a young birb, Birb had always wondered about the world Birb lived in.
              Was Bird a he or a she or an it? Birb never knew as Birb was always refered to as Birb.
              Birb didn't know how Birb was able to survive, continously banging Birb's head against pipes.
              Where were the other Birbs? Were there other Birbs? And why was the title above Birb in French?
              Birb did not have high expectations, but Birb always wanted to find more.
              <br><br>
              There had to be more to his existance.
              <br><br>
              Join birb as he travels the world, looking for the meaning to life, 
              the universe and everything (and it's not 42), whilst trying not to die the whole time.
